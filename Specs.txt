This project is a tiny REST / JSON web service in Java using Spring Boot (RestController) with an API 
that supports basic products CRUD:
	* Create a new product
	* Get a list of all products
	* Update a product

The API should also support:
	* Placing an order
	* Retrieving all orders within a given time period

A product should have a name and some representation of its price.
Each order should be recorded and have a list of products. It should also have the buyer’s e-mail,
 and the time the order was placed. The total value of the order should always be calculated, based
 on the prices of the products in it.
It should be possible to change the product’s price, but this shouldn’t affect the total value of 
orders which have already been placed.
